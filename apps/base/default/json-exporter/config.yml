      help: The current power consumed by devices attached to the switch

      help: The current state of the relay (wether or not the relay is currently turned on)

    - name: mystrom_temperature
      path: '{ .temperature }'
      help: The currently measured temperature by the switch. (Might initially be wrong, but will automatically correct itself over the span of a few hours)
      labels:
        mystrom: temperature
    - name: mystrom_Ws
      path: '{ .Ws }'
      help: The Ws field represents the average power value since the last call. It is the energy consumed divided by the time elapsed since the last call. Energy = Ws ∙ ∆T. For continous consumption measurements (Ws values with timestamp stored in DB) Total Energy = ∑Ws ∙ (Tcurrent - Tbegin).
